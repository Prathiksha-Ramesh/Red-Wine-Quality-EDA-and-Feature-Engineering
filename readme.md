# Red Wine Quality EDA and Feature Engineering

This project is dedicated to conducting a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on the "winequality-red.csv" dataset. The objective is to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and prepare the dataset for potential future modeling by applying various data transformation techniques.

## Overview

The primary focus of this project is to explore the physicochemical properties of red wine and how they relate to wine quality. Through visualizations and data transformations, we aim to provide a solid foundation for any subsequent modeling efforts, even though this project stops at the feature engineering stage.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizes statistical graphics and other data visualization techniques to understand the data better.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhances the dataset by creating new features and modifying existing ones to improve their utility in statistical modeling.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/red-wine-quality-eda.git
   cd red-wine-quality-eda
```

2. **Create a Python virtual environment:**
``` bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Use `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows

```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook to review the EDA and feature engineering steps:

``` bash 
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

Explore the notebook to see various analyses and transformations applied to the dataset.
